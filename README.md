## 🔒 Security & Privacy

🚨 **Important:** API keys and sensitive data should **never be shared** or committed to version control. This project follows best practices by:
- Using **environment variables** for API keys (e.g., `PEXELS_API_KEY = "API key from https://www.pexels.com/api/key/"`)
- Ignoring sensitive files like `node_modules/` and JSON datasets (`valid_counties.json`, `valid_counties_only.json`) via `.gitignore`
